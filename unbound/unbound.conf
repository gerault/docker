##### Client connection Settings

    # control which clients are allowed to make (recursive) queries

    # Harden against out of zone rrsets, to avoid spoofing attempts.

##### Upstream server definitions    

# Forward zones
# Create entries like below, to make all queries for 'example.com' and
# 'example.org' go to the given list of servers. These servers have to handle
# recursion to other nameservers. List zero or more nameservers by hostname
# or by ipaddress. Use an entry with name "." to forward all queries.
# If you enable forward-first, it attempts without the forward if it fails.
